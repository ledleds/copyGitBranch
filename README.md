# ðŸ“‹ CopyGitBranch 

I wrote this small Chrome Extension for a very particular use case:

Have you ever been reviewing a long PR and maybe you are halfway down the page and want to check the functionality of a test or see if you could improve the code written on your own machine? 

You have to scroll all the way to the top of the page to get the branch name so that you can checkout to that branch, then find where you were up to again in the code review. It used to irritate me. So I built this.

When clicked, this extension gets the branch name and copies it to your clipboard. No need to scroll back to the top. Simple.

```
Note: 
This will only work when you are viewing all files changed in a PR.
```
